0. Run combineData if split between multiple files

1. Collect data

2. run processTS.py
	- set deployID, relayIDs, and startDatetime

3. run plotDoorTest.py to get door sensor timestamps
	- set startDatetime 
	- enter deployID and relayID
	
4. run plotLastSession to get accelerometer activity at each door sensor timestamp
	- select correct files using file dialog window
	
5. run localization.py. Output is the most likely location (room number) at times t-1,t,t+1 for every t in dsData
	- enter information in numStates, states, relayStates, and maxTime
	- enter door sensor transitions in dsData (occupancy is unused)
	- enter data in expectedRSSIChange corresponding to the expected direction of the change in the RSSI for the transition
	- enter accel file names in accelProcFile(s) accelProcFile1 should correspond to the first relay station in relayStats
	- on line ~157 change number of rssi1, rssi2, etc. to the number of relay stations and add each to max(rssi1, rssi2, ...) (line ~161)
